## Niles can help you if...

* You want to create a single channel to manage events in your Discord server.
* You want to sync events from ([Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)).

## Setup

1. First [invite Niles](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=320434122344366082&scope=bot&permissions=523344) to your Discord server.

2. Now, either create a new Google calendar or use an existing one, and under **Settings > Calendars > 'Calendar Name'**, select 'Share This Calendar'. Under 'Share with a specific person' add `niles-291@niles-169605.iam.gserviceaccount.com` and make sure you give permission **Make changes to events**.

3. Next scroll down to 'Integrate calendar' and copy the **Calendar ID** - You'll need this to setup Niles in your Discord Server.

4. Run `!setup` in your `#general` to get started.

Visit the [setup page](https://niles.seanecoffey.com/setup) for more detailed setup information.

Multi-day events can be created with keywords " - " or " to " etc...
